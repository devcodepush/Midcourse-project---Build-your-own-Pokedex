## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser
- Text editor

### Installing

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/armanpartovi/Midcourse-project---Build-your-own-Pokedex.git

   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Pokedex.
   Usage
   HTML
   Write the HTML once, thinking about how your content will be distributed for each one of the cards. DonÂ´t worry about the images, follow this link to get all the pokemon thumbnails you might need.

### CSS
Assign the classes you might consider to the HTML elements. To make sure you're all good, take into account that inside your `styles.css` there should only be classes `.class` and IDs `#id`. Write your CSS and try to achieve the look and feel of the example. Don't worry though if you don't get the exact appearance. The important thing here is that your code is readable and uses the necessary CSS properties.


### JavaScript
Create an array of objects where you store all your Pokemons. Each Pokemon should have the following properties:

`thumbnail`: the path to the Pokemon's image,
`id`: the ID of your Pokemon (for instance, the position in the array),
`name`: the name of your Pokemon (for instance, 'Bulbasaur'),
`type`: an array of strings with each one of the types of each Pokemon. (For instance, Bulbasaur is type Plant and Poison)


### Bonus points
Try to make that hover effect when the cursor is pointing each one of the cards. Remember that the pseudo selector needed for this is :hover.
If you feel creative, try to reproduce the same animation you see on the Gif from above. Even though there are multiple ways of doing this, a good option is to use the CSS selector @keyframes.
